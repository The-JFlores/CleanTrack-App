# CleanTrack

## Introduction
CleanTrack is a mobile application designed to help cleaning staff organize and track building maintenance schedules more efficiently. Many buildings have different closing times, cleaning frequencies, and security requirements, which can make managing tasks challenging. CleanTrack centralizes this information by providing reminders, task details, and secure instructions, ensuring that cleaning is completed at the right time and in the right way.

## General Functionality
- **User Authentication**: Login with email and password to securely access tasks.  
- **Dashboard**: Overview of today’s cleaning tasks with priorities and time recommendations.  
- **Building Management**: List of assigned buildings, including address, closing times, and cleaning frequency.  
- **Task Details**: Access alarm codes, specific cleaning instructions, and additional notes for each building.  
- **Notifications**: Automated reminders for the best times to perform cleaning tasks and alerts for overdue work.  
- **Profile & Settings**: Manage user information, adjust notification preferences, and view assigned schedules.  

## Project Setup
This repository contains the source code and documentation for the CleanTrack mobile app. The project will be developed using a mobile-first approach and will be continuously updated with new features as development progresses.  

## GitHub Projects
